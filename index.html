        <h2>Checking out SCSS!</h2>

        <p>Today I'm checking out SCSS, which is known as Sassy CSS. I've never heard of this before, I've heard of SASS but not SCSS so it will be an interesting learning experience.</p>

        <h3>SASS vs SCSS</h3>
        <p>There are a few differences between SASS and SCSS. The main one is that SCSS's syntax is almost identical to traditional CSS, variables are declared using '$' and assignments are used with ':'.</p>

        <p>You can also use parent to child format to target certain elements to style specifically. This makes it a lot easier to get to an element without needing to refer to all the different css elements.</p>
